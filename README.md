# Data Analysis Project: Auto Insurance Analysis

This repository contains the code, data, and report for an analysis of auto insurance data from two sources: `austo_automobile` and `godigit_cc_data`.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of given data to derive insights and patterns that can aid decision-making in the insurance industry. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA).


## Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading: The data from both `austo_automobile` and `godigit_cc_data` sources were loaded into the analysis environment.
2. Data Cleaning: Missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies were addressed to ensure data quality.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations and summary statistics were used to understand the distributions, relationships, and trends within the data.
4. Conclusion is drawn based on data.
